#+TITLE: Machine Learning Environment

* Introduction

This project is a version of the [[https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace][ML Workspace]] created by SAP developers. The container is based on Ubuntu 20.04 and uses python 3.8. I simplified the original project by removing the graphical interface, VS code server and other functionality

* Highlights

- Comes preinstalled with the latest versions of Tensorflow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn and Pandas
- Includes popular visualization libraries
- Pre-installed NLP libraries and models (spaCy and NLTK)
- Comes with Jupyter and Jupyerlab
- Includes Apache Spark 3.0.0
